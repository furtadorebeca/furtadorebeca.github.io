								<h3>projects</h3>
								<p>These are mostly daily activities, some are weekly, and a couple are performed monthly.
								<hr />
								
								<ul class="alt">
									<li><b>Project Plan Review</b> - Check the project plan daily. Check with the team, the ones performing the tasks, if there are any impediments, any new risks or issues; address them accordingly. 
										Ensure we are on track to deliver everything by their deadlines. Mark completed tasks as such. Prepare for upcoming tasks. On Fridays, run the script to create next week's file.</li>
									<li><b>Project Finance Tracker</b> - Check the finance tracker. Ensure each team member is claiming their hours. Check if there is any concern about the budget. For long-term staff augmentation
										Request for Service (RFS), check if we're nearing the 80% budget consumption and if so, contact the sponsor and facilitate the creation of a Project Change Request (PCR). On Fridays,
										run the script to create next week's file.</li>
									<li><b>Client Meetings</b> - Meet with project sponsors and/or the client's project lead to go over the project status, progress, upcoming activities, budget consumption, and financial status.
										Meeting notes captured are sent to participants with the one-click option in OneNote. Upload project artifacts to the project folder on the client's SharePoint site.</li>
									<li><b>Vendor management</b> - On Tuesdays, review time sheets from the vendor's personnel per project. Validate hours and travel expenses. Raise any concerns on the weekly meeting. 
										Host a weekly meeting with the vendor's leadership to discuss time sheets, travel expenses, concerns, and areas for improvement. Update the issues tracker accordingly.
										Meeting notes captured are sent to participants with the one-click option in OneNote.</li>
									<li><b>Process, desk procedures documentation, and updates</b> - As required, create and/or validate steps with the RFS delivery manager. Publish the documentation. Meet with project managers to go over the steps.
										Use any feedback received from the PMs to improve clarity. Processes involving vendors are presented at the weekly meeting. </li>
									<li><b>Statement of Work (SOW) review</b> - <i>(initial process)</i> Involved in the management of the technical solution to ensure the proposal (SOW) is ready by the deadline. Arranged a meeting with all internal stakeholders to review the SOW.
										Host a meeting with account leadership, Subject Matter Experts (SMEs), <i>optionally</i> the architect for complex solutions, and the RFS manager to present the SOW and its pricing calculation. Once the SOW was approved internally, the 
										RFS manager submitted it to the client for approval. Checked if approval was not received on the expected date, and followed up with the client. <i>(later process)</i> Ran a script to create the project folder structure in SharePoint.
										Involved after the SOW was fully approved unless there was a need to follow up with the client on their approval.</li>
									<li><b>Stakeholder Management</b> - Check the list of stakeholders for the project on a weekly basis and update it accordingly. Gather feedback from the sponsor/client's PM if any name needs to be changed.
										 Verify that the communication frequency and methods are still satisfactory.</li>
									<li><b>RACI</b> - As required, for non-minimal projects, create RACI and review it from time to time.</li>
									<li><b>New projects</b> - Upon project assignment, review SOW, obtain the names of the resources from tower leads. Schedule internal kick-off. Prepare kick-off material. Request claim codes. Share claim codes and assist in
										troubleshooting if needed. Obtain feedback from team during the kick-off meeting. Prepare kick-off presentation for client meeting. Schedule and host kick-off meeting with team and client. Facilitate discussion, document
										any new information that would affect the project in any way, like dependencies, resource/material unavailability, etc. Update the project plan accordingly. Distribute meeting notes. Upload artifacts to project's SharePoint folder.
										Update financial spreadsheet file with resources names, rates, project budget, etc. <i>RFS Team Lead activity</i> - add any new project data (from all PMs) to RFS tracker spreadsheet. Add costs, rates, names, roles, start/end dates, claim code, etc.
										Update RFS tracker monthly with budget consumption for invoice preparation. Validate data from other PMs. Review file with RFS Delivery Manager and with Commercial team.</li>
									<li><b>Projects tracker</b> - Update file locally as data becomes available. On a weekly basis, double-check the data for accuracy and then update team's file in SharePoint. Present project updates to RFS Delivery Manager,
										answer any questions or concerns. <b>Improvement</b>: developed a local Excel file that not only had the tabular data to be used on the RFS team's file, but also fed the data to a dashboard-format worksheet. This
										solution reduced the overall updating time by approximately four hours. In addition to the time saving, it ensured better data quality with fewer errors.  </li>
									<li><b>Project working sessions</b> - As required, scheduled and facilitated meeting with cross-functional teams, to work on technical requirements and troubleshooting.</li>
									<li><b>Risks and Issues logs</b> Update them as required. Encouraged team participation to foresee issues and document risks. Escalated issues as required.</li>
