								<h3>Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) Initiatives</h3>
								<p>As the HSSSE Manager (HSSE = Health, Safety, Security and Environment), I had an incredible opportunity to create educational materials covering safety and security.<p>
									These are some of the initiatives I executed and some ideas I brought forward:
								<br>
								<ul class="alt">
									<li><b>HSSE Token</b>: I developed this initiative to engage and inspire our personnel to embedded safety and security in their processes.
									Every week we reported on the number of near misses reported against our target. Employees and contractors went above and beyond, not only reporting near misses,
									but also presenting safety moments in their meetings, using opportunities to coach people new to the sites. </li>
									<li><b>Newsletter in MS Sway</b>: A good deal of everyone's safety depends on each and everyone one of us. You probably heard or read somewhere that "Safety is everyone's responsibility".
									With our HSSE newsletter, we ,ade it fun to pay attention and embrace safety. We had trivia games, safety tips, security advices, and conveyed the importance of putting safety first. </li>
									<li><b>Smartphone/Tablet near miss app</b>: One of the things that came in the way of reporting near misses, was the lack of an effective way to report the issue right then and there. 
										I proposed the creation of an app, created mock screens, and described how it could be used to effectively report near misses. </li>
									<li><b>Safety walkthrough</b>: The difference a trained eye can have. A safety walkthrough aims to achieve, among other things, a safety workplace. Where at the end of the day, everyone
									goes back to their families in one piece, unharmed. Even in an office environment, you can spot many issues that can trigger an accident. As a trained OHS professional, I assisted IBM
									employees and contractors to find and remove anything that could harm them, their clients or their colleagues.
								 </li>
									<li><b>Hazard Identification and Task Risk Assessment training</b>: For every work that might have a hazard or involve a risk, it's crucial that you document each task of your activity and evaluate what could go wrong,
									 and apply methods to either mitigate or remove the potential for accidents. I worked with dozens of IT tecnicians to create an effective "hazard identification and task risk assessment" </li>
								</ul>
