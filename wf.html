								<h3>A few experiments using Make.com</h3>
								<p>In April 2025, I took one of the most useful courses in the productivity realm: Practical Application of Generative AI for Project Managers, 
									offered for free to PMI® members. Among many cool things I learned, I also had a chance to experiment and create amazing workflows.
									These are screenshots of 2 workflows I created: a <b>word analyzer</b> and a <b>news feed analyzer</b>. <hr />
									These workflows were created in Make.com, and their key components are ChatGPT and Google Docs.
								<br>
								<!-- <ul class="alt">
									<li>Found a mentor; one of these professionals who love what they do, and feel joy in sharing what they know.</li>
									<li>Attended a one-year certificate in Project Management at the University of Toronto - SCS.</li>
									<li>First important assignment, a client initiative, as an associate project manager.</li>
									<li>First official position as a project manager, where I learned a lot from my expert peers.</li>
									<li>Led an enterprise two-year complex project.</li>
									<li>Managed over 40 projects (small-medium-large), many of them concurrently.</li>
									<li><b>PMP®</b>: prepared for a few months, and on December 2, 2024, I wrote and passed the PMI's Project Management Professional (PMP®) exam on my first try! AT/AT/AT If you want to see how I did it, stay tuned. I'll share it here ;) </li>
									<li><b>CSM®</b>: Prepared for the Certified Scrum Master (CSM®) exam. _The preparation for the PMP exam, which 50% of the questions are about Agile and Hybrid methodologies, gave me a solid foundation to prepare for this exam. On January 19, 2025, I wrote and passed the CSM®.</li>

								<h4>Word Analyzer</h4>
								<p>The word analyzer gets the information entered in a JotForm form: job posting information and candidate resume. 
									It gets this information analyzed by ChatGPT using pre-determined keywords.
									The result is a feedback on how well aligned the two are and offers suggestions to improve the resume.
									The output is sent to a Google Docs file.</p>

									<hr />

								<h4>Feed News Analyzer</h4>
								<p>The feed analyzer collects news articles from pre-determined sources, parses it to HTML, and gets it analyzed by ChatGP.
									The output is sent to a Google Docs file.</p>
									<div class="col-4"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/make-feed_analysis.jpg" alt="News feed workflow" /></span></div>
