## Data Analytics Projects
### Data Jobs Market Analysis Project
This [project](https://github.com/furtadorebeca/3_RF_Project) was the result of taking the **Python for Data Analytics** created by [Luke Barousse](https://www.linkedin.com/in/luke-b) and [Kelly Adams](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kellyjianadams). The objective is to navigate and understand the job market for data positions more effectively. It delves into the top-paying and in-demand skills to help find optimal job opportunities for data analysts.

The data was sourced from [Luke Barousse's Python Course](https://lukebarousse.com/python), which provides a foundation for my analysis, containing detailed information on job titles, salaries, locations, and essential skills. Through a series of Python scripts, I explore key questions such as the most demanded skills, salary trends, and the intersection of demand and salary in data analytics.
